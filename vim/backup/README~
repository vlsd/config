To install (on *nix systems, including OS X):
$ cd
$ mkdir texmf && cd texmf
$ mkdir tex && cd tex
$ mkdir latex && cd latex
$ mkdir labtex

Add the labtex.sty file in this new folder and, in your .tex document, add

\usepackage{labtex}

after you include all other packages. I *think* the dependencies are only
amsmath.sty and amsfonts.sty. Can someone please check?
